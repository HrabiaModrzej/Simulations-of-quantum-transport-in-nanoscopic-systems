# Simulations of Quantum Transport in Nanoscopic Systems

This repository contains solutions to class projects related to quantum transport in nanostructures.

Each project focuses on a different system or method used to calculate transport properties. The project topics include:

1. **Galerkin method** for calculating electronic states in a two-dimensional parabolic potential  
2. **Transfer matrix method** applied to a resonant tunneling diode and a quantum point contact  
3. **KWANT package** used to calculate transport properties in a nanowire and a Y-shaped junction  
4. **KWANT package** used for the analysis of a spin transistor
